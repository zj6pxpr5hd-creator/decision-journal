This is a simple Decision Journal where you can save decisions, the reason bihind them and how confident were you in making them.
In doing this project i learn how to deal with user input, how to save data locally with localStorage and a few things about styling.

For future improvement the style could be made more professional and welcoming for users, I could add a results section that saves  the results of the decisions and helps recognizes recurring patterns in good and bad decisions (ex. by adding additional data about decisions).
This features haven't been implemented because this is a starting project, not a finished product.
